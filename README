# okku

Okku is a Clojure wrapper for the Akka library. Akka is an erlang-inspired Scala library implementing the Actor model for concurrency and distribution.

The Akka library has a Java interface, but using it directly from Clojure is rather unwieldy as it is mainly based on subclassing, and requires some juggling with factories (see "bare" examples in src/cloka/samples).

For explanations on the Actor model itself and how and when to use it, see the documentation of either Akka or Erlang.

## Usage

From Clojure, Akka is mostly useful for the relatively transparent distribution it allows; concurrency is already well supported in Clojure.
